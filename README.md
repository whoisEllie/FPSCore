**FPS Core is a simple, easy-to-use plugin that makes building shooters in Unreal Engine faster and easier**

It abstracts a number of core functions and behaviours (hence, FPS Core) to pre-made C++ classes while exposing their properties to Blueprints, allowing anyone to modify their functionality - even if you don't know how to code. Ready to get started? Grab it from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fps-core) and get started with the online [documentation](https://emmadocs.dev)!

### installation
You'll likely have the best experience installing FPS Core through the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fps-core). This way you get the most up-to-date production ready binaries, so there's no compilation required.

If you'd like to compile your own copy, you can clone from the main branch without hesitation - this is always kept up to date with the latest stable release, and mirrors the version found on the Unreal Engine Marketplace. In order to download bleeding-edge releases, you'll have to pull from a branch.

### alternate versions
If you're looking for versions of FPS Core with support for alternate features, you might find them in some public forks. Notable forks are listed here.
- (https://github.com/TheMarcusDev/FPSCore): This fork by Marcus Henrique is fully replicated, and has modifications that bring it closer to a CS-style game, such as sprint being the default movement state.
    
### learning and docs
The best way to get started with FPS Core is by following the QuickStart! series on the [documentation site](https://emmadocs.dev). You can find the first part of that [here](https://emmadocs.dev/fps-core/quickstart-part-1-creating-a-character/). Currently, there is no complete API reference. This will come with the impending 2.0 release, which should arrive in Q2 2024. In lieu of such documentation, you're welcome to ask any API-related questions in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/MzxdZd2WqR).

### getting help
The best place to get support is the [EMMA Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MzxdZd2WqR), which includes additional features such as a GPT-4 powered assistant and the ability to suggest features and report bugs.

Alternate means of getting support are:
- [emailing me](mailto:contact@emmadocs.dev)
- creating a github issue
- asking a question using the marketplace

### contributing
Contributions are welcomed! Whether you're working on bug fixes, adding new features or commenting, I'm always happy to discuss outside changes to the plugin - make a PR and let's chat!

### license
FPS Core is licensed under an MIT license, a permissive license that places few restrictions on reuse. Wherever you're planning to use FPS Core, you're probably fine! You can read more in the [LICENSE](LICENSE).
